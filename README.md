- Pre-installed Python packages tailored for geospatial and Earth Observation workflows
- Structured Jupyter notebook tutorials to support initial onboarding

## Usage Advisory

- The Sandbox is intended strictly for educational and prototyping purposes and is not suited for production workflows.
- All notebook files within the Sandbox are subject to periodic updates; modifications may be automatically replaced.  
  **Recommendation:** preserve progress externally (e.g., GitHub or local directories).

## Structure

### English Version

This is the primary version of the notebooks, serving as the original source on which development is focused.

### Indonesian Version

This folder contains translations of the notebooks into Indonesian, based on the main English versions.

> **Note:**  
> Updates and new features may be developed first in either the English or Indonesian notebooks, depending on community needs and preferences. Both versions are maintained and may occasionally be ahead or behind each other as translations and updates are completed.
